<h2>
What is in Roblox?
</h2>

<p>
Roblox has tens of millions of games on the platform. These games are all made by Roblox developers.<br> Roblox developers are just normal people who go onto Roblox And download the Roblox studio app to<br> create any game they want. Remember, in roblox, anyone can create games which is the reason why there<br> are so many. The best part is,<li>There is no limit to making games</li> <li>You rarely have to write any code;just search up an object in Roblox's studio app and place it anywhere! <li>You can <strong> easily</strong> make an ingame Roblox curency called <strong>robux</strong> by developing a game</li><br>
You can also change your avatar and use robux to purchase new accessories, <br>faces and more! You can even buy some robux from the roblox store including <br>robux giftcards from the real life stores. Robux is not only used for changing<br> your ingame look, but you can buy gamepasses from games.(thats how people<br> make robux from making games but keep in mind, there is a 30% robux tax!)
